    "text": "For this project, I am seeking to address the manner in which women have been represented in the film industry changed over time (roles, financing, Box office). How have these changes look when comparing films, not in English?\n\n\n\nMy motivation in doing so relies mainly on the fact as someone who identifies as a woman of color, I have always seen a gender gap in environments in most professional spaces I come across ranging from higher education to the world of entertainment. Though I have seen such spaces become more gender inclusive with time, I wish to see how the film industry specifically has improved. Additionally, how has Hollywood worked to include non-English speaking countries through time?\n\n\n\nDataset: https://github.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/blob/master/all_actors_movies_gender_gold.csv\nIn this project, I am using the “All_actors_movies_gender_gold” dataset provided by user taubergm on GitHub. Containing hundreds of rows of data from 2000 to 2018, this dataset features several variables such as Film titles, country/language, financials, and cast information such as lead actor or actress and most importantly their gender.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above this dataset is compiled of several variables such as Year and Date of Release, Film Name, Country, Budget/Gross (stop at September 2018), Film Runtime, Film Cast and Gender. This said, gender is categorized into a binary meaning cast members who may not feel identified by either category might be left out or misgendered. Additonally, it does not capture intersecting film cast identities such as gender and ethnicity.\nPotential Data Visualizations (4):\n1)Line plot of the number of films released 2000 - 2018\n2)Box plot of film funding for women\n3)Bar graph of language/country distribution in films\n4)Line plot film budget over time (use average for each year)\n\nhwdata = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/master/all_actors_movies_gender_gold.csv')\n\nprint(hwdata)\n\n       year                   name            country     budget      gross  \\\n0      2000  Mission: Impossible 2  ['United States']  125000000  546400000   \n1      2000  Mission: Impossible 2  ['United States']  125000000  546400000   \n2      2000  Mission: Impossible 2  ['United States']  125000000  546400000   \n3      2000  Mission: Impossible 2  ['United States']  125000000  546400000   \n4      2000  Mission: Impossible 2  ['United States']  125000000  546400000   \n...     ...                    ...                ...        ...        ...   \n20366  2018              Destroyer  ['United States']        NaN        NaN   \n20367  2018              Destroyer  ['United States']        NaN        NaN   \n20368  2018              Destroyer  ['United States']        NaN        NaN   \n20369  2018              Destroyer  ['United States']        NaN        NaN   \n20370  2018              Destroyer  ['United States']        NaN        NaN   \n\n      runtime          starring     language    released  gender  \n0         123        Tom Cruise  ['English']  2000/05/24    male  \n1         123     Dougray Scott  ['English']  2000/05/24    male  \n2         123    Thandie Newton  ['English']  2000/05/24  female  \n3         123  Richard Roxburgh  ['English']  2000/05/24    male  \n4         123       John Polson  ['English']  2000/05/24    male  \n...       ...               ...          ...         ...     ...  \n20366     123     Nicole Kidman  ['English']  2018/08/31  female  \n20367     123   Tatiana Maslany  ['English']  2018/08/31  female  \n20368     123    Sebastian Stan  ['English']  2018/08/31    male  \n20369     123      Toby Kebbell  ['English']  2018/08/31    male  \n20370     123     Scoot McNairy  ['English']  2018/08/31    male  \n\n[20371 rows x 10 columns]\n\n\n\n## DATA VIZ 1: Line Plot of Films released 2000 -

    "text": "Throughout the years, films have made their way to become one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the present day going so far as to become essential in the formation of pop culture. As shown by the massive growth in the box office domestically, the last decade has proven to be the most successful in film history so far. However, despite this tremendous financial growth, the same cannot be said for gender inclusion in Hollywood.\n\n\nOver the course of history and as shown by the U.S. Department of Labor women’s participation in the labor market has increased across several fields, including the film industry. While women have always been seen participating in multiple areas of filmmaking since the inception of the industry, their work and participation have gone unnoticed, forgotten, and ignored as if they never existed. Dating back to the era of Silent Film, women were a key part of film production working predominantly behind the scenes as writers, directors, cinematographers, and editors just to name a few roles. While opportunities to become involved were present, these openings soon began to dwindle as the film industry flourished. Having then been forced out of key roles, some women still wanting to participate in the creation of films were led to marriages of convenience where their work would not be credited to them but to their husbands.\nLuckily with great demand for new and improved content by audiences, some studios allowed women to form part of the team in limited roles with specific tasks. Particularly at Disney, one of the most progressive studios at the time, women were given a spot in the Ink and Paint Department where they colored film cels for animated films and told explicitly not to expect a promotion to the Animation department reserved for men. Eventually, Disney would ease restrictions across all departments, and women were allowed to join teams across the many areas of film production eventually leading to the dominant studio it has become.\nAll of this said, in recent years there has been more notable growth in movements and research such as Women In Film, Women Make Movies, and the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative addressing the need for women in film and other media spaces. Nonetheless, despite women being 50% of the total US population as reported by the U.S. Census and efforts to bring new faces into the field, it is clear that Hollywood has yet to achieve proportional representation both on and off-screen.\n\n\n\nFor this project, I seek to address the manner in which women have been represented in the film industry changed over time, particularly in the roles of writers, cast members, producers, and writers.\n\n\n\nMy motivation in doing so relies mainly on the fact as someone who identifies as a woman, I have always seen a gender gap in environments and most professional spaces I come across ranging from higher education to the world of entertainment. Though I have seen such spaces become more gender inclusive with time, I wish to see how the film industry specifically has improved, as films have a big impact on people’s perceptions of the world around them.\n\n\n\n\nAs highlighted in the section above, women’s participation across the many areas of film creation has seen to have improved since the industry began but despite the said improvement many of the roles that women are part of are unfortunately still hugely male-dominated. To get a better understanding of the gender gap that exists in the film industry, I made use of exploratory data analysis tools available in Python to examine inequality for some key roles in filmmaking such as lead role, writer, producer, and director. Additionally, I also looked at the gross revenue for films depending on the lead cast’s gender.\n\n\nTo carry out this project, I made use of 4 primary datasets all of which were published on GitHub in the Hollywood Gender Data repository by user taubergm. Containing thousands upon thousands of rows of data ranging from 2000 to 2018, these datasets in a CSV format feature several variables useful for my analysis.\nThe primary and central dataset sourced for this project was the “all_actors_movie_gender_gold” dataset which contains hundreds of thousands of rows of data from 2000 to 2018. Detailing several variables such as the film title, country of film origin, budget, gross revenue, film runtime, lead cast member names, language, and release date. However, most important to our analysis was the year of the film release, the names of lead cast members in the film, and their respective gender all in a CSV format.\nCast data: https://github.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/blob/master/all_actors_movies_gender_gold.csv\nThe second dataset sourced for this project was the “all_directors_gender” dataset which contains 5077 rows of data about films ranging from 2000 to 2018. Detailing several variables such as the film title, country of film origin, budget, gross revenue, film runtime, director names, language, and release date. However, most important to our analysis was the year of the film release, the names of film directors, and their respective gender all in a CSV format.\nDirector data: https://github.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/blob/master/all_directors_gender.csv\nThe third dataset sourced for this project was the “all_producer_gender_gold” dataset which contains 12440 rows of data about films ranging from 2000 to 2018. Detailing several variables such as the film title, country of film origin, budget, gross revenue, film runtime, producer names, language, and release date. However, most important to our analysis was the year of the film release, the names of film producers, and their respective gender all in a CSV format.\nProducer data: https://github.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/blob/master/all_producers_gender_gold.csv\nThe fourth dataset sourced for this project was the “all_writers_gender” dataset which contains 5952 rows of data about films ranging from 2000 to 2018. Detailing several variables such as the film title, country of film origin, budget, gross revenue, film runtime, writer names, language, and release date. However, most important to our analysis was the year of the film release, the names of film writers, and their respective gender all in a CSV format.\nWriter data: https://github.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/blob/master/all_writers_gender.csv\n\n\nTo best visualize the data I primarily used a stacked bar chart signaling the distribution of films worked on by each gender identity for each release year. On the x-axis was the number of films released and on the y-axis was the corresponding year. Four of these plots were made each for the roles studied. Additionally, while trying to make comparisons more clearly and accessible, females were assigned a blue color, males an orange color, and unknown in gray.\nCombining all of these datasets made it possible to analyze the relationship between gender and different key roles in the film industry over time. However, it is also important to note that throughout these datasets and consequently this project, gender is categorized into a binary meaning cast members who may not feel identified by either category or whose gender identity was not found might be left out or misgendered which may result in an “unknown” classification.\n\n#Packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport folium\n\n#Datasets: \n\n#cast dataset is primary dataset\ncast = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/master/all_actors_movies_gender_gold.csv')\n\nwriter = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/master/all_writers_gender.csv')\n\nproducer = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/master/all_producers_gender_gold.csv')\n\ndirector = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/master/all_directors_gender.csv')\n\n#Color Palette for graphs: Female: Blue, Male: Orange, Unknown: Gray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin this analysis, I started off by enumerating the number of films released domestically each year from 2000 to 2018. In doing so, I wanted to highlight the number of film projects made available in the field which has been growing with time which women could have been a part of. We can see that compared to the year 2000 which only had about 140 films released, by 2018 there were about 200 films released clearly marking a jump. Additionally, we can see that in the years ranging from 2008 to 2010, there was an increase in the number of films released with the highest recorded number being over 260 films.\n\n#Line Plot: Films released 2000 - 2018\n\n#Filtering film title duplicates\ncast_unique = cast.drop_duplicates(subset=['name'])\nfilm_year = cast_unique.groupby('year')['name'].nunique().reset_index(name='Count')\n\nax = film_year.plot(x='year',\n                    y='Count',\n                    kind='line',\n                    figsize=(11, 5),\n                    linewidth=3)\n\nax.set_title('Films Released Per Year Domestically (2000-2018)')\nax.set_xlabel('Release Year')\nax.set_xticks(range(2000, 2019))\nax.set_ylabel('Number of Films Released Domestically')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow with a better idea of how many films were released, I compared the total number of films released each year from 2000 to 2018 while showing the distribution of films for each gender based on the lead cast. Clearly, we can see that while over time there has been an increase in the number of women taking on lead roles in film, the distributions for each year between each gender are nowhere close to equal. We can see that while the highest number of women were cast as leads in 2018 in over 50 films, men in the same year were starring in about double the number of films.\n\n#Stacked Bar: CAST gender \ncast_single = cast.drop_duplicates(subset=['name'])\ncastgender_year = cast_single.groupby(['year', 'gender'])['name'].count().reset_index()\n\npivoted = castgender_year.pivot(index='year', columns='gender', values='name')\n\nax = pivoted.plot(kind='bar',\n                  stacked=True,\n                  figsize=(6,6),\n                  color=['royalblue','darkorange','darkgrey'])\n\nax.set_title('Lead Cast Gender by Film Release Year')\nax.set_xlabel('Release Year')\nax.set_ylabel('Number of Films')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue to our concern regarding the existing gender gap between men and women in the film industry this graph shows that as writers, women are most greatly underrepresented. While the unknown classification in this particular graph is notable, given the number of positions of women in the film industry overall, we can infer that the number of women as writers yearly is not likely to surpass the number of male writers.\n\n#Stacked Bar: WRITER gender\nwriter_single = writer.drop_duplicates(subset=['name'])\nwritergender_year = writer_single.groupby(['year', 'gender'])['name'].count().reset_index()\n\npivoted = writergender_year.pivot(index='year', columns='gender', values='name')\n\nax = pivoted.plot(kind='bar',\n                  stacked=True,\n                  figsize=(6,6),\n                  color=['royalblue','darkorange','darkgrey'])\n\nax.set_title(' Writer Gender by Film Release Year')\nax.set_xlabel('Release Year')\nax.set_ylabel('Number of Films')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the analysis, in this plot we can see that when it comes to producing a film women are unsurprisingly underrepresented in this area compared to their male counterparts. Though there has been a slight increase from the lowest point in 2001 when women were producing less than 25 films, to its highest in 2010 and 2015 when they produced about 50 films, it is still no match for the rates of men.\n\n#Stacked Bar PRODUCER gender\nproducer_single = producer.drop_duplicates(subset=['name'])\nproducergender_year = producer_single.groupby(['year', 'gender'])['name'].count().reset_index()\n\npivoted = producergender_year.pivot(index='year', columns='gender', values='name')\n\nax = pivoted.plot(kind='bar',\n                  stacked=True,\n                  figsize=(6,6),\n                  color=['royalblue','darkorange','darkgrey'])\n\nax.set_title('Producer Gender by Film Release Year')\nax.set_xlabel('Release Year')\nax.set_ylabel('Number of Films')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of all the number of films released each year, the number of males directing films is much greater than female directors. Looking at the other roles analyzed we can see that for this position, similar to that of writers, is one of the most affected by the gender gap. We can most clearly see this underrepresentation in the year 2001 when there were no women directing films while during the same year over 100 films were being directed by men.\n\n#Stacked Bar: DIRECTOR gender\ndirector_single = director.drop_duplicates(subset=['name'])\ndirectorgender_year = director_single.groupby(['year', 'gender'])['name'].count().reset_index()\n\n#Removing extra data point from dataset which lists'202013' as a year]\ndirectorgender_year = directorgender_year[directorgender_year['year'] != 202013]\n\npivoted = directorgender_year.pivot(index='year', columns='gender', values='name')\n\nax = pivoted.plot(kind='bar',\n                  stacked=True,\n                  figsize=(6,6),\n                  color=['royalblue','darkorange','darkgrey'])\n\nax.set_title('Director Gender by Film Release Year')\nax.set_xlabel('Release Year')\nax.set_ylabel('Number of Films')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this map, my main goal was to showcase the countries from which films originate. This was done in hopes to showcase that most films are coming from the United States which is seen as a leader in the world in terms of GDP and progressive movements. Consequently, most of the data analysis focuses on the United States.\n\n#MAP of Film Countries\n\n#new row for each country listed in the country column\ncast_new_rows = cast_single.explode('country')\n\ncountry_data = cast_new_rows.groupby('country')['country'].count().reset_index(name='count')\ncountry_geo = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium/main/examples/data/world-countries.json'\n\nmap = folium.Map(location=[0, 0], zoom_start=2)\n\nfolium.Choropleth(\n    geo_data=country_geo,\n    data=country_data,\n    key_on=\"feature.id\",\n    columns=['country', 'count'],\n    fill_color=\"YlGn\",\n    legend_name=\"Number of films\",\n).add_to(map)\n\nmap\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -> Trust Notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an already clear understanding that women are underrepresented across key aspects of the film creation process, to get more of an idea of how this plays out post-production I provided an analysis of the average gross revenue yearly for films for each gender. Through the line plots, we can see that early on from 2000 to about 2010 the revenue between genders was different as the film revenue for women was not changing much at a lower rate than their male counterparts. However, the real difference is from around 2010 to 2014 when male leads were seeing the biggest return in terms of gross revenue. Closely after female leads would make their big break starting in 2013 to 2017 when they would be matching the revenue of men.\n\n#Line Plot: Average Gross Revenue for Films with Female Leads per Year\nfemale_cast = cast_single[cast_single['gender'] == 'female']\nfemale_cast['gross'] = pd.to_numeric(female_cast['gross'], errors='coerce')\n\ngrouped = female_cast.groupby('year')['gross'].mean()\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ngrouped.plot(ax=ax,\n             linewidth=3,\n             figsize=(10, 5))\n\nax.set_title('Average Gross Revenue for Films with Female Leads per Year')\nax.set_xlabel('Year')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Gross Revenue (USD, M)')\nax.set_xticks(range(2000, 2019))\n\nplt.show()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_50/370484559.py:3: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  female_cast['gross'] = pd.to_numeric(female_cast['gross'], errors='coerce')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Line Plot: Average Gross Revenue for Films with Male Leads per Year\nmale_cast = cast_single[cast_single['gender'] == 'male']\n\nmale_cast['gross'] = pd.to_numeric(male_cast['gross'], errors='coerce')\ngrouped = male_cast.groupby('year')['gross'].mean()\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ngrouped.plot(ax=ax,\n             linewidth=3,\n             figsize=(10, 5))\n\nax.set_title('Average Gross Revenue for Films with Male Leads per Year')\nax.set_xlabel('Year')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Gross Revenue (USD, M)')\nax.set_xticks(range(2000, 2019))\n\nplt.show()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_50/681539476.py:4: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  male_cast['gross'] = pd.to_numeric(male_cast['gross'], errors='coerce')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, we can conclude that unfortunately in accordance with historical precedence there still stands an evident gender gap in the film industry in key roles regarding filmmaking where women are significantly underrepresented. Through the data visualizations and analysis we were able to see that though women have slowly been able to pick up some positions from 2000 to 2018, the number of films yearly is still not proportional to that of men. In this way, it is clear that in a society that prides itself on its efforts to provide equal opportunities to people of all backgrounds regardless of gender, it is lacking and should be addressed.\n\n\n\nWhile our analysis of gender in the film industry is a good starting point to assess inequality happening in the field, it in no way tells the whole story. Going forward, paying attention to other factors such as age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, economic status, and other intersections of identity should be researched.\n\n\n\n\nCuller, B. M.
